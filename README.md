# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
Welcome to my personal repository! This project is a collection of my implementations and solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms problems, written in C++.
The goal of this repository is to practice and master different DSA concepts while exploring the efficiency of algorithms and optimizing code solutions.

## Overview
This repository includes a variety of DSA topics, ranging from fundamental concepts to more advanced algorithms. Some of the topics covered are:

* Arrays & Strings
* Linked Lists
* Stacks and Queues
* Trees (Binary Tree, AVL Tree, Binary Search Tree)
* Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, etc.)
* Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort, BubbleSort, etc.)
* Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search)
* Dynamic Programming
* Greedy Algorithms
* Backtracking
* Recursion
* Hashing
